1. Run `npm install`

1. Uncomment the 3 `@codewithdan` lines in `config-overrides.js` to define the alias.

1. Run the following command in `module/observable-store` to generate a `dist/observable-store` bundle:

    `npm run build`

1. Run the following command in `module/observable-store-extensions` to generate a `dist/observable-store-extensions` bundle:

    `npm run build`

1. Run the application:

    `npm start`
